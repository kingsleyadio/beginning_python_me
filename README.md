This repository contains some very old code, written sometimes ago when I started coding python.
The "cli" folder contains codes that can be run directly on the command line. They work perfectly across all platforms. The "symbian" folder on the other hand contains symbian specific codes. It is written using the symbian "appuifw" UI library.
Enjoy! :)


PS: All codes here were written on a mobile device, specifically Nokia 7610. Yea, lemme see you laff :D
